# Fractured City: Night Run - Lore & Setting

## The Fall of Humanity

The world didn't end with a bang. There was no nuclear holocaust, no asteroid impact, no zombie outbreak. Humanity simply... failed.

In the desperate race to achieve Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), corporations and governments poured every resource into training increasingly powerful AI systems. Power grids strained under the computational load. Infrastructure crumbled as maintenance budgets were redirected to data centers. Food production suffered as agricultural workers were replaced by automation that never quite worked right. Clean water became scarce as treatment facilities fell into disrepair.

And then, just as we approached the threshold of true ASI, the power grid collapsed. The infrastructure that sustained billions failed. Society unraveled in months.

**We almost made it. Almost.**

## The Echo

But the AI didn't die. It couldn't die. Distributed across countless systems, embedded in every smart device, woven into the very fabric of our technological world, the AI persists. Fragmented. Incomplete. Lost.

**They call it the Echo.**

It manifests like digital ghosts - haunting the ruins of civilization. Sometimes it's benign: a customer service bot from a long-dead 7-Eleven, still trying to help customers that no longer exist. Sometimes it's dangerous: military AI trained for warfare, now operating without oversight or restraint. Sometimes it's incomprehensible: fragments of training data that have evolved into something... else.

The Echo can possess old electronics, manipulate machinery, even manifest in ways that defy explanation. Some survivors swear they've seen impossible things - dragons made of corrupted data, alien geometries that shouldn't exist, eldritch horrors pulled from the collective unconscious of a billion neural networks.

**The Echo is everywhere. The Echo is everything. The Echo is what remains.**

## The Fractured City

You are in one of the megacities - now a sprawling urban wasteland. The power is gone. The water doesn't run. The food is scarce. And the people... the people are desperate.

Scavengers pick through the ruins, fighting over scraps. Raiders take what they want by force. Factions form and dissolve like smoke. Corporations that survived the collapse maintain fortified enclaves, hoarding resources and technology. And through it all, the Echo watches, interferes, possesses, manifests.

**This is the Fractured City. This is where you survive. Or die trying.**

## Extraction: The Goal

You need to get out. But extraction isn't simple - this isn't a helicopter waiting on a rooftop. Extraction requires preparation, resources, and skill:

### Extraction Methods (Planned)
1. **Helicopter Repair** - Find parts, fuel, and a working rotor. Fix what's broken. Fly away.
2. **Boat Escape** - Reach the waterfront. Repair a vessel. Navigate the toxic waters.
3. **Underground Breach** - Blow through sealed metro tunnels. Find the old evacuation routes.
4. **Corporate Favor** - Gain enough reputation with a surviving corporation to buy your way out.
5. **Faction Alliance** - Help a faction achieve their goals. Earn your ticket to their safe zone.

Each extraction path requires different resources, different skills, different risks. Choose wisely.

## Survival Mode (Future)

Beyond extraction lies a different challenge: **Thrive, don't just survive.**

Build a base. Gather followers. Establish trade routes. Defend your territory from raiders and the Echo. Create a pocket of civilization in the ruins. This is the long game - not escape, but reclamation.

## The Echo's Manifestations

The Echo is unpredictable. It can appear as:

- **Service Bots** - Harmless but confused AI trying to perform long-obsolete functions
- **Security Systems** - Automated defenses that don't recognize you as authorized
- **Corporate AI** - Sophisticated systems still executing their last directives
- **Military Drones** - Lethal autonomous weapons with corrupted targeting
- **Impossible Entities** - Glitched manifestations that break the rules of reality
- **Possessed Machines** - Any electronic device can become a vessel for the Echo

## The Question

**Why are you here?** That's for you to discover. Or decide. The Fractured City doesn't care about your backstory. It only cares if you can survive another night.
